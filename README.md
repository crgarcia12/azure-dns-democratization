# Azure Dns Democratization
*REPO IN EARLY DEVELOPMENT STAGE*

## Problem statement
DevOps is a software development approach that promotes velocity and team autonomy. To achieve this, large organizations often look into their processes, identifying steps that are not optimal or that slow down innovation.

DNS is a service that is designed to be democratized and decentralized, but large or heavily regulated organizations may require close control over it.

Having a fully centralized DNS solution can create friction and limit the possibilities for teams to use modern techniques like blue-green deployments or disaster recovery in some situations.

This repository experiments with the idea of giving Application Teams the autonomy to manage their own DNS subdomains while maintaining full organizational control and strong auditing trails.
